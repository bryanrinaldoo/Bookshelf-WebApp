Bookshelf is a web application that helps you to manage your book.
You can add your new book to Bookshelf easily. Bookshelf divided into two shelves, 'Reading' and 'Done'.
The 'Reading' is the shelf that contains books that you are currently reading. As for 'Done' is the shelf that contains books that you already completed.

Bookshelf was made to fulfill an assignment at Dicoding. This is my second website and my first webapp that i made by myself. Well the template of the website is pretty much the same as the twice-website, because i don't have much time and i have to focus on javascript too. The focus on this assignment is how i manipulate DOM, manipulate the data, and pretty much all about JS. So the appearance of the website is not rated, but better appearance better score right? hahaha. 

In this assignment, I can use any framework I want to help me with the appearance of the website, so I use bootstrap and sweetalert. Well, I have use bootstrap many times, but it's my first time using sweetalert and I loved it. It got many cool features and I'm very amazed. I'm pretty sure I will use sweet alert again hahaha. Well if you have any other cool framework that I might be using, you can contact me hahaha.

All the features can be found on the website so I think I won't explain them here. 
I think that's all I want to say, thank you for visiting! Hope you like it!
